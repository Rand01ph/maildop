                                <p>a. Information You Provide to Us: When you register to use the Services, communicate with our customer service team, send us an email, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, and other details like gender, occupation, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, and stored by us, only as described in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
                                <p>b. List and Email Information: When you add a List or create an email with Maildop, we have access to the data on your list and the information in your email.</p>
                                <p>c. Information from your Use of the Service: We may get information about how and when you use Maildop. This information may include your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions taken by you within the application.</p>
                                <p>d. Cookies: When you register to use Maildop, we store "cookies," which are strings of code, on your computer. We use those cookies to collect information about when you visit our Website, when you use Maildop, your browser type and version, your operating system, and other similar information. You may turn off cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser, but if you block our cookies, it may be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use Maildop.</p>
                                <p>e. Email Data: When we send emails to registered Maildop customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure our Email Campaigns’ performance and to improve our features for specific segments of customers. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.</p>
                                <p>f. Information from Other Sources: We may get more information about you, like name, age, and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties. We only collect data that’s publicly available or provided by a third party according to its terms of use.</p>

We don’t, under any circumstances, sell your lists, contact people on your lists, market to people on your lists, steal your lists, or share your lists with any other party, unless it’s required by law. If someone on your list complains or contacts us, we may then contact that person. Only authorized employees of Maildop have access to view Lists of users.</p>

                                <p>We use technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. No data transmissions over the Internet, however, are guaranteed to be completely secure. While we strive to protect your data from unauthorized use or disclosure, Maildop.com cannot warrant or guarantee the security of the data that you provide to us. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you or people on your Distribution Lists, then Maildop will notify you as soon as possible.</p>

                                <h3 class="site-heading">9. CONFIDENTIAL CONTENT</h3>
                                <p>When you send email marketing, it bounces around from server to server as it crosses the internet. Along the way, server administrators can read what you send. Email wasn’t built for confidential information. If you have something confidential to send, please don’t use Maildop.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes we review the content of our Users’ email campaigns to make sure they comply with our Terms of Service. To improve that process, we have software that helps us find email campaigns that may violate our Terms. Our employees or independent contractors may review those particular Email Campaigns. This benefits all of our Members who comply with the Terms of Service because, among other things, it reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps to maintain high deliverability.</p>
